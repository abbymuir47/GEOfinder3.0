                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">A common goal for researchers is to find multiple datasets that address similar research topics and to either combine them directly or integrate inferences from them. However, a major challenge is finding relevant datasets due to the vast number of candidates, inconsistencies in their descriptions, and a lack of semantic annotations. </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">GEOFinder aims to help researchers find additional relevant datasets by applying a large language model to curate accurate, relevant datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. Our research found that language models offer more accurate and relevant dataset search results compared to GEO's built-in "Advanced Search Builder". GEOFinderâ€™s language model-powered search tool exists as a helpful supplement to increase accessibility to existing research in the GEO database.</p>
                        <p>To use GEOFinder:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Upload a file containing GEO dataset IDs or manually input one or more GEO Series (GSExxx) identifiers relevant to your research. </li>
                                <li>GEOFinder searches the GEO repository for similar datasets.</li>
                                <li>Results are presented with a direct link to the GEO website for further examination.</li>
                            </ol>                           
            
                        <p>GEOFinder was developed by Dr. Piccolo and graduate and undergraduate students at Brigham Young University.</p>
