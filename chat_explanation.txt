The error message youâ€™re seeing indicates that there's a problem with how you're trying to filter a DataFrame in Pandas. Let's break down the error and its context:

### Error Breakdown

1. **Traceback**:
   - The traceback shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error. It starts from the `query` method and goes through `bottom_half_html`, `validate_input`, and finally to `filter_by_metas` in `helper.py`.

2. **Specific Error**:
   - The key part of the error is:
     ```
     ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all().
     ```
   - This error occurs when you attempt to evaluate a Pandas Series in a boolean context where it expects a single boolean value (True or False).

### The Problematic Line

The offending line in your `filter_by_metas` function is:

```python
df_copy = df_copy[df_copy["Samples_Range"] in metadata_dct["Num_Samples"]]
```

### Why This Causes an Error

- **Ambiguous Condition**: The expression `df_copy["Samples_Range"] in metadata_dct["Num_Samples"]` evaluates to a Series of boolean values, not a single boolean. In Python, the `in` operator checks membership, and when used with a Series, it returns an array of booleans. This is ambiguous when used for indexing.
  
### How to Fix It

You likely want to filter the DataFrame such that you keep only the rows where the values in the `"Samples_Range"` column are contained in `metadata_dct["Num_Samples"]`. You should use the `.isin()` method for this:

```python
df_copy = df_copy[df_copy["Samples_Range"].isin(metadata_dct["Num_Samples"])]
```

### Corrected Function Example

Here's how the corrected `filter_by_metas` function might look:

```python
def filter_by_metas(metadata_dct):
    df_copy = df_copy.copy(deep=True)
    df_copy = df_copy[df_copy["Samples_Range"].isin(metadata_dct["Num_Samples"])]
    # Continue with any additional processing...
    return df_copy
```

### Summary

- The error occurs due to trying to use the `in` operator with a Pandas Series, which leads to ambiguous truth values.
- Use `isin()` for filtering DataFrame columns based on membership in a list or Series.
- Always ensure your filtering conditions return a clear boolean Series for indexing.
